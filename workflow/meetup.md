 ### Overview
 This document identifies the workflow involved with meetup invites. There are generally 3 types of meetup invites 
 that can be assocaited with *Meetup* for code-for-durham. The document lays out the format and tries to identify
 the content for each type.
 
 ### Types of meetup invites
 
 #### Generic meetup:
This is the most common meetup that occurs periodically every two weeks. This starts with a general meet-and-greet followed
by pre-identified teams that spilt into their own respective groups. This is also a meetup that can be tough and imposing
to new members. 
Meetup description / email invite can be segregated into sections:
  **Generic section (For brand new users (persona 1/2)**
  - Introduction.
      ```
      Hello and welcome to code-for-durham. (General hello message)
      Checkout these websites: 
      https://www.codeforamerica.org/
      https://codefordurham.com/
    ```
  - Code of conduct link.
    ```Link to code-for-conduct (If any)```
  - Recommended workflow for new-users.
    ```Based on the workflow identified, can edit this section.```
  
  **Slack invite section (For persona 1/2)** - automated tool that adds people to the channel.
  
  **Project section: (For all personas)**
  - A link to a place (codefordurham.com/projects/... most likely? ) that contains a very brief intro to active projects.
    Each project can lead up to to more details specific to each project. And have links to *skills development* section that
    contains any tutorials/talks pertaining to each project.
  - *Project matchmaking tools.*
  - *Generic skill development section*

  #### Specific meetup:
This is a meetup that is specific to a particular project. This could be organized by the project group 
or is initiated by people who are requesting help from the code-for-durham memebers to meet their
project needs.
This will be customized for the specific project.
In general, they can contain higlights or key-words associated with the project. And request people
to join if they can contribute.
Since, mostly this is assocaited with a new project, the skills or the matchmaking will not be 
applicable here.

- Introduction.
    ```
    Code-for-durham requests you to volunteer time for XYZ. RSVP to the event if interested in contributing
    and have skills/experience in following: [list of skill points]
    ```
- Generic section (Refer:[Generic Section](#generic-meetup)).

#### IceBreakers:
This is a meetup for fun and meeting like mided people. No projects associated. Just a general 
meet and greet followed by games. In a hopeful corona-free world, could also be done in the *outdoors*.

Could contain the same content as the [Generic meetup](#generic-meetup)
  
  
### Sample workflows
  **Persona 1/2**
  As new user, I'd check on generic and project specific sections before the first meetup. 
  And during the meetup I'd ideally join up with the project that I'd feel matches my interest most. 
  This'd involve utilizing the match-making section as well. And probably join up slack once I feel i can contribute. 
  
  **Persona 3**
  As returning user finding an intro to new projects, I'd sign up to a meetup or get invited to the zoom meeting reminder through slack.
  Go to the projects section (this link would probably be well known by now ?) and browse through. If needed, will also use the matchmaking tool.

  **Persona 1/2/3**
  If unsure of the best fit after the matchmaking/ not satisfied with project recommendations/ Just want to try something
  new to learn new skills: I'd make use of the skills section from a few projects to learn something new. And go with something that I feel interesting.
