Code for Durham Design Thinking Session	

Objective: Identify steps to improve the project onboarding experience for new and repeat members so people feel welcome, are able to contribute, and inspired to return.	

Summary of Outcomes: Big ideas that accumulated the most votes were Tutorials and Skills Development Sessions, Onboarding Tools, and Project Matchmaking. The next step is to identify workstream leads to carry this effort foward, and team members to help.
