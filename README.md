# codefordurham-newmembersupdate

In April 2020 the group decided to have a few Design Thinking sessions to determine how to improve the new member and onboarding process. Design Thinking sessions are a way to get everyone in a group to share their ideas, identify common pain points, generate ideas for solutions, and come to a consensus about the next steps. A summary of the sessions and outcomes appears below, and the details can be found in the .xsls file in this repository. 

**Objective:**
Identify steps to improve the project onboarding experience for new and repeat members so people feel welcome, are able to contribute, and inspired to return.	

**Summary of Outcomes:**
Big ideas that accumulated the most votes were Tutorials and Skills Development Sessions, Onboarding Tools, and Project Matchmaking. The next step is to identify workstream leads to carry this effort foward, and team members to help.

**Participants:**
Millie S. (Design Thinking Facilitator), Celeste R., Laura B., *Brian T.*, *Chris E.*, David E., *Dev D.*, John S., *Kevin M.*, *Rachel F.*, Colin C., and Dane S. (*indicates newer members*)
